## 🕵️‍♂️ Why This Tool Exists
> **"Seeing is no longer believing."**

In 2024 alone, deepfake fraud cost companies over **$25 Billion**. From fake CEO calls to political disinformation, synthetic media is the new cybersecurity threat.

Existing tools are too slow (analyzing every frame) or too dumb (looking at static pixels). **AIthentic** was built to catch the one thing AI generators can't hide yet: **The Glitch in Time.**

## 💡 The "Bouncer" Analogy (How it works simply)
Imagine a nightclub bouncer checking IDs.
* **Traditional Detectors** just glance at the ID photo. If it looks real, you get in. (Deepfakes pass this easily because they generate perfect static images).
* **AIthentic** doesn't just look at the photo. We ask you to **blink, talk, and turn your head.** We watch the *video* of your movements. If your lips jitter unnaturally or your blinking looks robotic, we know it's a fake.

## 🔬 Scientific Foundation & Architecture

Our architecture is a hybrid implementation derived from state-of-the-art forensic research.

### 1. ⚡ Active Entropy Sampling (AES)
* **The Logic:** 90% of a video frame is useless background. Processing it is a waste of GPU.
* **The Fix:** We calculate the **Pixel-Difference Entropy** for the entire video stream.
* **The Result:** The system ignores static noise and surgically extracts the **Top 20 High-Motion Frames** (e.g., mid-blink, lip purse)—the exact moments where Deepfakes glitch.

### 2. 👁️ Spatial Feature Extraction (EfficientNet-B3)
* **Research Reference:** Inspired by *Li et al. (CVPRW 2019)*.
* **Theory:** Deepfakes rely on affine warping to fit a face onto a head. This leaves microscopic artifacts at the blending boundaries.
* **Implementation:** We use a pre-trained **EfficientNet-B3** to extract a 1536-dimensional feature vector encoding these subtle texture anomalies.

### 3. 🧠 Temporal Sequence Modeling (Bi-LSTM)
* **Research Reference:** Inspired by *Liu et al. (WACV 2023)*.
* **Theory:** Fake videos suffer from "Temporal Identity Inconsistency"—the face in Frame 1 is mathematically slightly different from Frame 2.
* **Implementation:** A **Bidirectional LSTM** analyzes the vector sequence *forwards and backwards*, catching **Temporal Jitter** (micro-flickering) caused by generator incoherence.
