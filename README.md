## 📝 Description
AIthentic is an enterprise-grade forensic platform designed to expose Deepfake media by analyzing temporal inconsistencies invisible to the human eye. Unlike traditional detectors that analyze static frames, our system uses **Active Entropy Sampling** to target high-motion segments and employs a **Hybrid Spatial-Temporal Network (EfficientNet-B3 + Bi-LSTM)** to detect micro-flickers and warping artifacts. The platform achieves **96.71% accuracy** and features a cyber-forensic dashboard with a live neural terminal and an integrated AI assistant.

### Machine Learning Pipeline
1.  **Input Processing:** Video stream is scanned for high-entropy motion using pixel-difference algorithms.
2.  **Spatial Analysis (The Eye):** EfficientNet-B3 strips classification heads to extract 1536-dimensional feature vectors, spotting skin warping and blending artifacts.
3.  **Temporal Analysis (The Memory):** Bi-Directional LSTM analyzes vector sequences forward and backward to detect "Temporal Jitter" (micro-flickering).

## 📈 Progress

### Fully Implemented Features
* **Active Entropy Sampling:** Successfully filters 90% of useless background frames to optimize inference speed (~2.5s per video).
* **Hybrid Detection Core:** The EfficientNet-B3 + Bi-LSTM architecture is fully trained and verified with **96.71% Test Accuracy** and **0.99 Precision**.
* **Forensic Dashboard:** A complete UI with "Bouncer" logic visualizations, file upload, and real-time "Live Terminal" logs.
* **Gemini Assistant:** Integrated chatbot that explains forensic verdicts (e.g., "Why is this fake?") to non-technical users.

### Partially Implemented Features / Work in Progress
* **Advanced Telemetry:** Detailed breakdown of specific artifact types (Lighting vs. Texture) is currently approximated; moving towards granular head-specific detection.
* **Edge Deployment:** Work is underway to quantize the model for mobile/CCTV deployment to reduce size without losing accuracy.

## 🔮 Future Scope
* **Audio-Visual Sync:** Integration of Wav2Lip-based models to detect desynchronization between lip movements and audio tracks.
* **Adversarial Defense:** Training the model against "anti-forensic" noise attacks (Gaussian blur/compression) to ensure robustness in the wild.
* **Browser Extension:** Developing a lightweight browser plugin to flag synthetic media on social platforms (X/Twitter, LinkedIn) in real-time.

## 💸 Applications
* **Legal & Judiciary:** Authenticating video evidence in court to prevent tampering or fabrication.
* **News & Media:** Verifying political speeches and breaking news footage before broadcast to combat disinformation.
* **Digital Identity (KYC):** Enhancing banking security by detecting "virtual camera" injection attacks during remote video verification.
